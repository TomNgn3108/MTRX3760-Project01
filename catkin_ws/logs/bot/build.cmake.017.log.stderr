[31m[1mCMake Error[0m at /home/thomas/catkin_ws/src/bot/CMakeLists.txt:139 (add_dependencies):
  Cannot add target-level dependencies to non-existent target "bot".

  The add_dependencies works for top-level logical targets created by the
  add_executable, add_library, or add_custom_target commands.  If you want to
  add file-level dependencies see the DEPENDS option of the add_custom_target
  and add_custom_command commands.
